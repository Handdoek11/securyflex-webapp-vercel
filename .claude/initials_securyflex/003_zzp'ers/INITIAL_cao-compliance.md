# INITIAL: CAO Compliance & Dutch Labor Law Automation System

## FEATURE:
Build comprehensive CAO (Collective Labor Agreement) compliance system specifically for Dutch security industry, automating working time directives, rest period enforcement, overtime calculations, youth worker protections, and break requirements. The system must prevent violations through real-time monitoring, provide automated documentation for inspections, calculate complex wage structures, and ensure 100% compliance with Dutch security sector CAO regulations preventing costly fines and legal issues.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Real-time working time monitoring with 48-hour weekly average enforcement
- Automatic rest period validation (11 hours between shifts, 36 hours weekly)
- Youth worker protection (special rules for 15-22 years old)
- Overtime and Sunday/holiday premium calculations
- Break scheduling enforcement for long shifts
- Night shift regulations and compensation tracking
- Annual leave accrual and management
- Compliance reporting for labor inspections

## EXAMPLES:
Reference these existing patterns and implementations:

**Legal Framework Foundation:**
- `INITIAL_dutch-legal-compliance.md`: Arbeidsrecht compliance with ‚Ç¨87,000 penalty prevention
- Working Time Act (Arbeidstijdenwet) enforcement
- Security industry specific CAO requirements
- Inspectie SZW audit preparation and documentation

**Shift Planning Integration:**
- `INITIAL_shift-planning-scheduling.md`: CAO validation in scheduling system
- Automatic prevention of illegal shift combinations
- Rest period calculations between consecutive shifts
- Weekly hour tracking with rolling averages

**Database Schema Foundation:**
- Working time records with precise tracking
- Rest period validation logs for compliance
- Youth worker age verification and restrictions
- Overtime and premium calculations storage

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Continuous compliance checking during shift assignment
- Automatic alerts before violations occur
- Manager escalation for exception handling
- Documentation for approved exemptions

## DOCUMENTATION:
**CAO Security Sector Requirements:**
- Maximum 48 hours per week (4-week average calculation)
- Minimum 11 hours rest between shifts (reducible to 8 hours once weekly)
- Maximum 9 hours per shift (extendable to 10 hours)
- Minimum 36 hours continuous weekly rest (or 72 hours biweekly)
- Youth workers: Progressive limits from 15-18 years

**Compliance Automation:**
- Proactive violation prevention through scheduling constraints
- Real-time validation during shift assignment process
- Automatic documentation generation for inspections
- Historical compliance reporting with trend analysis
- Exception handling with proper authorization tracking

**Financial Implications:**
- Overtime rates: 125% (first 2 hours), 150% (subsequent hours)
- Sunday premium: 150% of base rate
- Holiday premium: 200% of base rate
- Night shift allowance: ‚Ç¨1.50-3.00 per hour
- Standby compensation: 10-15% of hourly rate

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **Working Time Engine**: Real-time hour tracking, rolling average calculations, predictive violation alerts, exception management, compliance scoring, audit trail generation
2. **Rest Period Validator**: Automatic enforcement between shifts, weekly rest calculations, break scheduling, fatigue management, recovery time tracking, exemption documentation
3. **Youth Protection System**: Age-based restrictions, school hour considerations, night work prevention, parental consent tracking, special break requirements, education coordination
4. **Premium Calculator**: Overtime rate application, Sunday/holiday premiums, night shift allowances, standby compensation, travel time inclusion, bonus calculations
5. **Inspection Readiness**: Automated report generation, compliance certificates, violation history, corrective actions, inspector portal access, real-time data export

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't ignore rolling averages - 48-hour limit is calculated over 4 weeks, not single weeks
- Don't skip youth verification - severe penalties for violating minor protection laws
- Don't forget break documentation - unpaid breaks must be properly recorded
- Don't allow manual overrides without authorization - all exceptions need documentation
- Don't neglect standby time - counts partially toward working hours
