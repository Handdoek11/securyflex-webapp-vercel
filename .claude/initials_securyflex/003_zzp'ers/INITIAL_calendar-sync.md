# INITIAL: Native Calendar Synchronization & Integration System

## FEATURE:
Build seamless calendar synchronization system enabling bidirectional sync between SecuryFlex and native calendar applications (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar), providing unified schedule management, conflict prevention, automatic reminders, and cross-platform availability. The system must support real-time sync, offline capability, time zone handling, and intelligent conflict resolution, ensuring security professionals never miss shifts while maintaining work-life balance.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Bidirectional sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, and Apple Calendar
- Real-time updates with minimal latency (<30 seconds)
- Conflict detection preventing double-booking
- Automatic reminder configuration with customizable lead times
- Time zone handling for international operations
- Offline capability with deferred synchronization
- Privacy controls for personal vs work calendar separation
- Color coding and categorization for different shift types

## EXAMPLES:
Reference these existing patterns and implementations:

**Calendar Integration Foundation:**
- `INITIAL_shift-planning-scheduling.md`: Native calendar sync requirements for shift management
- Two-way synchronization maintaining data consistency
- Conflict prevention between personal and work events
- Reminder notifications with customizable timing

**Technical Integration Patterns:**
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for Google Calendar API
- Microsoft Graph API for Outlook integration
- CalDAV protocol for Apple Calendar sync
- Webhook subscriptions for real-time updates

**Database Schema Integration:**
- Calendar connection tokens with refresh handling
- Sync status tracking with last update timestamps
- Conflict resolution logs for audit trails
- User preferences for sync behavior

**Mobile Integration:**
- PWA calendar access with native feel
- Push notifications for calendar reminders
- Background sync for offline changes
- Deep linking to native calendar apps

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Synchronization Requirements:**
- Real-time bidirectional sync maintaining consistency across platforms
- Selective sync allowing users to choose which shifts to sync
- Conflict resolution with user-friendly merge strategies
- Privacy preservation keeping personal events separate
- Performance optimization for large calendar datasets

**Platform Support:**
- Google Calendar: Full integration via REST API
- Outlook/Office 365: Microsoft Graph API support
- Apple Calendar: CalDAV protocol implementation
- Generic CalDAV/iCal: Support for other calendar systems
- Mobile calendars: iOS and Android native app integration

**User Experience:**
- One-click calendar connection with OAuth flow
- Automatic sync without manual intervention
- Visual indicators for sync status and conflicts
- Bulk operations for multiple shift management
- Undo capabilities for accidental changes

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication flows, token refresh management, permission scoping, multi-account support, revocation handling, security compliance
2. **Sync Engine**: Bidirectional data flow, conflict detection algorithms, merge strategies, delta synchronization, batch processing, error recovery
3. **Event Mapping**: Shift to calendar event conversion, property mapping, recurrence handling, reminder configuration, attendee management, location integration
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic detection, user prompts, merge strategies, priority rules, history tracking, rollback capabilities
5. **Performance Optimization**: Incremental sync, caching strategies, rate limiting, bulk operations, background processing, connection pooling

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't ignore rate limits - calendar APIs have strict quotas requiring careful management
- Don't sync everything - selective sync prevents calendar overload
- Don't forget time zones - incorrect handling causes missed shifts
- Don't skip conflict resolution - automatic overwrites lose important data
- Don't neglect privacy - work calendars shouldn't expose personal information

**Calendar Sync Architecture:**
```
Synchronization Flow:
├── 🔐 Authentication (OAuth flow, token management, permissions)
├── 🔄 Sync Engine (bidirectional sync, delta updates, conflicts)
├── 📅 Event Mapping (shift conversion, properties, reminders)
├── ⚡ Real-time Updates (webhooks, push notifications, polling)
├── 💾 Offline Queue (local storage, deferred sync, recovery)
└── 🔍 Conflict Resolution (detection, merging, user prompts)
```

**Platform-Specific Implementations:**
```
Calendar Platforms:
├── Google Calendar: REST API v3, OAuth 2.0, push notifications
├── Outlook: Microsoft Graph, delegated permissions, webhooks
├── Apple Calendar: CalDAV, basic auth or OAuth, subscriptions
├── Generic CalDAV: Standard protocol, compatibility mode
└── Mobile Native: iOS EventKit, Android Calendar Provider
```

**Event Property Mapping:**
- Title: Shift location and role (e.g., "Security - Ajax Arena")
- Description: Detailed shift information, client details, requirements
- Location: GPS coordinates and address with navigation links
- Start/End: Exact shift times with buffer for travel
- Reminders: Configurable alerts (1 hour, 30 min, custom)
- Color: Category-based (regular, urgent, high-pay)
- Attendees: Team members for group shifts
- Status: Confirmed, tentative, cancelled

**Conflict Detection Strategies:**
- Time overlap: Detecting scheduling conflicts with existing events
- Travel time: Calculating feasibility between consecutive shifts
- CAO compliance: Preventing rest period violations
- Personal events: Respecting blocked time and vacations
- Recurring conflicts: Pattern detection for regular commitments

**Privacy & Security Features:**
- Selective sync: Choose which shifts appear in personal calendar
- Data minimization: Only sync necessary information
- Encryption: Secure token storage and data transmission
- Audit logging: Track all sync operations for compliance
- Revocation: Instant disconnection with data cleanup

**Sync Performance Optimization:**
- Delta sync: Only transfer changed events
- Batch operations: Group multiple changes
- Caching: Local storage for offline access
- Compression: Reduce data transfer size
- Connection pooling: Efficient API usage

**Reminder Configuration:**
- Default reminders: 1 hour and 30 minutes before shift
- Custom reminders: User-defined timing and methods
- Travel time: Automatic calculation based on location
- Escalating alerts: Multiple reminders for critical shifts
- Snooze options: Temporary reminder postponement

**Time Zone Handling:**
- Automatic detection: User's current time zone
- Shift time zone: Preserve original scheduling zone
- DST transitions: Proper handling of daylight saving
- International ops: Multi-zone shift display
- Travel adjustments: Update for location changes

**Offline Capabilities:**
- Local calendar cache for offline viewing
- Queue changes for later synchronization
- Conflict detection with cached data
- Automatic sync on connection restore
- Failure recovery with retry logic

**Integration Dependencies:**
- Authentication system for OAuth flows
- Shift management for event data source
- Notification system for sync alerts
- GPS system for location enrichment
- User preferences for configuration

**Error Handling & Recovery:**
- API failures: Exponential backoff with retry
- Token expiration: Automatic refresh flow
- Conflict resolution: User-guided merge process
