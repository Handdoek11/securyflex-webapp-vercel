## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **Trust Signal Hierarchy**: WPBR badge (top priority), user testimonials (social proof), security icons (technical trust), success metrics (performance proof)
2. **Urgency Implementation**: Time-limited bonuses, live activity feeds ("5 shifts posted in last hour"), real-time user counters
3. **Mobile Conversion Focus**: Simplified CTAs, thumb-friendly navigation, progressive forms, WhatsApp quick contact
4. **A/B Testing Strategy**: CTA button colors, hero messaging variants, bonus amount optimization, form length testing
5. **User Type Differentiation**: Specific value props per audience, tailored social proof, relevant success stories

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't overload with trust signals - creates suspicion rather than confidence
- Don't use generic urgency tactics - must be authentic to security industry
- Don't ignore mobile conversion paths - 60%+ traffic is mobile
- Don't skip statistical significance in A/B tests - false positives damage conversion
- Don't forget accessibility in conversion optimization - inclusive design improves overall conversion
