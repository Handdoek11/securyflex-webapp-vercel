Build a comprehensive portal application for bedrijven en organisaties die beveiligingsdiensten inhuren (klanten). The application provides opdracht placement, offerte comparison, live monitoring, and communication with beveiligingsbedrijven.

- Navigation: ðŸ“ŠDashboard, ðŸ“‹Opdrachten, ðŸ’°FinanciÃ«n, ðŸ‘¤Profiel
- Opdracht placement flow: describe needs â†’ receive offertes â†’ select beveiligingsbedrijf
- Real-time GPS tracking of assigned beveiligers during active diensten
- Incident reporting and communication with beveiligingsbedrijven
- Invoice management and payment via Finqle
- Multi-location support for organizations with multiple vestigingen

## EXAMPLES:
Reference these existing patterns and implementations:

- `src/models/Schema.ts` lines 168-197: Shifts schema adapted for client service requests
- `src/models/Schema.ts` lines 140-167: Organizations schema for client companies

**Service Booking Foundation:**
- Multi-step booking wizard with service type selection
- Date/time scheduling with recurring booking options
- Personnel requirements specification (number, specializations, certifications)

**Real-time Service Monitoring:**

- Real-time incident notifications and status updates

**UI Components for Professional Interface:**
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components for professional client interface
- Booking wizard components with clear progress indication
- Map integration for live tracking and location services

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Architecture Reference:**
- `wireframes/004_bedrijven/`: Complete client portal wireframe collection

**Service Categories:**

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
