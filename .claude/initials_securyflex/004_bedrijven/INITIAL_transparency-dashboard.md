# INITIAL: Real-Time Transparency Dashboard & Client Portal

## FEATURE:
Build a comprehensive real-time transparency dashboard that provides clients with complete visibility into security service delivery, personnel location tracking, incident reporting, performance metrics, and financial transparency. The system must address the transparency crisis in Dutch security industry (Netherlands dropped to 9th place on anti-corruption index) by providing unprecedented visibility into all aspects of security service delivery with live GPS tracking, real-time updates, and tamper-proof audit trails.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Real-time GPS tracking display of all assigned security personnel
- Live service delivery status with photo verification and timestamps
- Transparent pricing breakdown with no hidden fees or margin stacking
- Real-time incident reporting with immediate client notification
- Performance metrics dashboard with KPI tracking and historical data
- Financial transparency with real-time billing and payment status
- Audit trail system with immutable logging for compliance
- Client communication portal with direct messaging and video calls

## EXAMPLES:
Reference these existing patterns and implementations:

**Market Transparency Crisis:**
- Netherlands anti-corruption ranking dropped to 9th place (lowest ever measured)
- Margin stacking problems in security procurement violating principles
- Lack of transparency in GPS tracking and service delivery
- Clients demanding more visibility into security service quality

**GPS Integration Foundation:**
- `wireframes/003_zzp'ers/03-gps-checkin-flow.md`: Real-time location tracking wireframes
- `src/hooks/useRealtimeGPS.ts`: Live GPS tracking implementation patterns
- PostGIS spatial queries for location verification and geofencing

**Real-time Dashboard Patterns:**
- `src/hooks/useRealtimeShifts.ts`: Live shift status updates
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components for data visualization
- Real-time subscription patterns for live data streaming

**Client Portal Integration:**
- `wireframes/004_bedrijven/01-dashboard-bedrijfsoverzicht.md`: Client dashboard wireframe
- Multi-location support for enterprise clients
- Performance monitoring and reporting capabilities

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Transparency Requirements:**
- Complete service delivery visibility from assignment to completion
- Real-time location tracking with privacy compliance (AVG/GDPR)
- Financial transparency eliminating margin stacking concerns
- Performance accountability with measurable KPIs

**Technical Architecture:**
- Real-time data streaming using Supabase subscriptions
- GPS tracking integration with privacy controls
- Audit logging with blockchain-level immutability
- Multi-tenant data isolation for client security

**Anti-Corruption Compliance:**
- Transparent pricing models with no hidden fees
- Open procurement processes with competitive bidding
- Real-time service verification preventing fraud
- Audit trails for regulatory compliance and inspections

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **Real-Time GPS Tracking**: Live location updates every 30 seconds, geofencing alerts, route optimization display, privacy controls for off-duty periods
2. **Service Delivery Verification**: Photo timestamps, check-in confirmations, incident documentation, quality assurance monitoring
3. **Financial Transparency**: Real-time billing updates, fee breakdown display, payment status tracking, no hidden costs guarantee
4. **Performance Analytics**: KPI dashboards, historical trend analysis, service quality metrics, client satisfaction scoring
5. **Communication Hub**: Direct messaging, video calls, emergency contact, escalation procedures, multilingual support

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't compromise on real-time updates - delayed information undermines transparency
- Don't skip privacy controls - GPS tracking must respect employee rights
- Don't hide any costs - complete financial transparency is essential for trust
- Don't overlook mobile optimization - clients check status on mobile devices
- Don't implement without audit trails - regulatory compliance requires documentation
