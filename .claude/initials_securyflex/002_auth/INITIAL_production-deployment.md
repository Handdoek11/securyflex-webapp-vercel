# INITIAL: Production Deployment & DevOps Infrastructure

## FEATURE:
Establish comprehensive production deployment infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, security hardening, performance optimization, and automated testing. Create a robust DevOps setup that ensures 99.9% uptime, automated deployments, comprehensive monitoring, security compliance, and disaster recovery capabilities for the SecuryFlex platform across development, staging, and production environments.

**Specific Requirements:**
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, security scanning, and deployment
- Production infrastructure on Vercel with custom domain and SSL configuration
- Comprehensive monitoring with Sentry error tracking, Better Stack uptime monitoring, and Checkly synthetic testing
- Security hardening including HTTPS enforcement, security headers, and vulnerability scanning
- Performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking and alerting
- Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Environment variable management and secrets handling
- Database migration automation and rollback capabilities

## EXAMPLES:
Reference these existing patterns and implementations:

**Core Infrastructure Foundation:**
- `CLAUDE.md`: Performance targets (99.9% uptime, <3s load times, <2s GPS check-in)
- `SECURYFLEX_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Production infrastructure overview
- `package.json`: Build scripts, testing commands, and deployment configurations

**Database Production Setup:**
- `src/models/Schema.ts`: Database schema with migration management
- Drizzle migration system with version control and rollback capabilities
- Supabase production configuration with scaling and backup

**Monitoring & Observability:**
- Sentry configuration for error tracking and performance monitoring
- Better Stack setup for uptime monitoring and alerting
- Checkly integration for API endpoint and user journey monitoring

**Security Infrastructure:**
- Clerk production authentication settings with security headers
- API security with CORS configuration and rate limiting
- Database security with RLS policies and encryption at rest

## DOCUMENTATION:
**Deployment Architecture:**
- Vercel deployment with custom domain (securyflex.nl) and SSL
- Multi-environment setup (development, staging, production)
- Automated deployment from Git with branch protection rules

**Performance Requirements:**
- Core Web Vitals targets: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- 99.9% uptime SLA with automated failover capabilities
- GPS functionality: <2s check-in completion, <5s location acquisition
- Real-time features: <50ms latency for critical updates

**Security Compliance:**
- HTTPS enforcement with security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Environment variable encryption and rotation procedures
- Database encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, security scanning, deployment approval workflows, rollback procedures
2. **Monitoring Stack**: Error tracking, performance monitoring, uptime alerts, user journey testing
3. **Security Hardening**: HTTPS enforcement, security headers, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
4. **Performance Optimization**: CDN configuration, image optimization, caching strategies, database indexing
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backups, disaster recovery procedures, data retention policies

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't deploy without proper environment variable validation
- Don't skip database migration testing in staging environment
- Don't forget to configure monitoring before production release
- Don't overlook security header configuration for production
- Don't deploy without proper backup and rollback procedures

**Infrastructure Components:**
```
Production Environment:
├── Vercel (Frontend hosting)
│   ├── Custom domain with SSL
│   ├── Edge caching configuration
│   └── Environment variable management
├── Supabase (Database & Real-time)
│   ├── Production database with scaling
│   ├── Row Level Security policies
│   └── Automated backups
├── Monitoring Stack
│   ├── Sentry (Error & performance tracking)

```

**Deployment Pipeline:**
1. Code commit to main branch triggers automated testing
2. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
3. Staging deployment for integration testing
4. Production deployment with zero-downtime strategy
5. Post-deployment monitoring and health checks

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) for actual user experience
- Synthetic monitoring for critical user journeys
- Core Web Vitals tracking with alerting thresholds
- Database performance monitoring with query optimization

**Security Procedures:**
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Environment variable rotation and access audit
- Incident response procedures for security breaches

**Disaster Recovery:**
- Automated daily database backups with point-in-time recovery
- Geographic backup distribution for disaster resilience
- Recovery time objective (RTO): <4 hours
- Recovery point objective (RPO): <1 hour
