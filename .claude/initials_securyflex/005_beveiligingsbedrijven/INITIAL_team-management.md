## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

**Critical Implementation Details:**
1. **Professional Database**: Complete profiles, skill matrices, certification tracking, availability management, performance history, preference settings, relationship scoring
2. **Team Builder**: Requirement matching, skill optimization, availability checking, cost balancing, performance weighting, diversity considerations, backup planning
3. **Performance System**: KPI tracking, feedback collection, quality scoring, improvement plans, recognition programs, warning systems, termination procedures
4. **Communication Hub**: Broadcast messaging, team channels, shift briefings, document sharing, video calls, emergency alerts, feedback loops
5. **Retention Management**: Loyalty tracking, incentive programs, career development, preferred status, exclusive opportunities, relationship building, exit interviews

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Don't treat ZZPs as employees - maintain proper independent contractor relationships

- Don't skip performance feedback - continuous improvement requires communication
- Don't forget team chemistry - skills alone don't guarantee team success
- Don't neglect loyalty - top performers have many opportunities elsewhere
