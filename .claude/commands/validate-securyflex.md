# SecuryFlex System Validation

Complete end-to-end validation of all SecuryFlex systems including GPS accuracy, payment processing, security compliance, and performance metrics.

## Usage

```
/validate-securyflex [component]
```

## Components

- `all` - Complete system validation (default)
- `gps` - GPS verification and location services
- `payments` - Finqle payment integration and 24h SLA
- `mobile` - PWA performance and offline capability
- `security` - GDPR/WPBR compliance and security audit
- `dutch` - Dutch language coverage and localization

## Validation Process

### 1. GPS Accuracy Validation
```bash
# Check GPS check-in accuracy within 50m radius
npm run validate:gps
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ Location accuracy < 50 meters
- ✅ Photo capture requirement for check-in
- ✅ Offline capability with sync
- ✅ Battery optimization settings
- ✅ Radius configuration per shift

### 2. Payment SLA Validation
```bash
# Test 24-hour payment guarantee
npm run validate:payments
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ Webhook processing < 2 seconds
- ✅ Payment completion within 24 hours
- ✅ Finqle API integration
- ✅ Transaction status tracking
- ✅ Fee calculation accuracy

### 3. Mobile Performance Validation
```bash
# PWA and mobile optimization check
npm run validate:mobile
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
- ✅ Time to Interactive < 3.5s
- ✅ GPS lock time < 5 seconds
- ✅ Photo compression < 2 seconds
- ✅ Offline functionality 100%

### 4. Security Compliance Validation
```bash
# GDPR/WPBR security audit
npm run validate:security
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ GDPR/AVG compliance
- ✅ WPBR registration requirements
- ✅ Data encryption at rest/transit
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Zero critical vulnerabilities

### 5. Dutch Localization Validation
```bash
# Language coverage and compliance
npm run validate:dutch
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ 100% UI translation coverage
- ✅ Dutch legal terminology
- ✅ Currency formatting (EUR)
- ✅ Date/time localization
- ✅ Error messages in Dutch

## Critical Performance Gates

### Business Journey Targets
- **ZZP GPS Check-in**: Must complete < 2 seconds
- **Company Shift Creation**: Must complete < 30 seconds
- **Client Service Request**: Must complete < 45 seconds
- **Payment Processing**: Must complete < 2 seconds
- **PWA Install Prompt**: Must appear < 10 seconds

### Success Rate Requirements
- **GPS Check-in Success**: > 95%
- **Payment Success**: > 99.5%
- **Shift Assignment**: > 80%
- **Mobile Retention**: > 70% monthly
