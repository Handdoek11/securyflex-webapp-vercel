## üîÑ User Workflow Comparisons

### 1. ZZP Job Discovery & Application

#### Mobile Workflow (Optimized for Speed)
```mermaid
journey
    title ZZP Mobile Job Discovery
    section Browse
      Open app           : 5: ZZP
      View job cards     : 4: ZZP
      Swipe through jobs : 5: ZZP
    section Quick Filter
      Tap filter icon    : 4: ZZP
      Select location    : 5: ZZP
      Apply filters      : 5: ZZP
    section Apply
      Tap apply button   : 5: ZZP
      Confirm details    : 4: ZZP
      Submit application : 5: ZZP
```

**Mobile Advantages:**
- **Speed**: 3-tap application process
- **Location awareness**: GPS-based job filtering
- **Push notifications**: Instant job alerts
- **Touch-optimized**: Large buttons, swipe gestures

**Mobile Limitations:**
- **Limited information**: Condensed job details
- **No bulk operations**: One job at a time
- **Small screen**: Difficulty comparing multiple jobs
- **Network dependency**: Requires good cellular connection

#### Desktop Workflow (Optimized for Detail)
```mermaid
journey
    title ZZP Desktop Job Discovery
    section Advanced Search
      Open jobs page     : 4: ZZP
      Use search filters : 5: ZZP
      Sort by relevance  : 5: ZZP
    section Compare Options
      Open multiple tabs : 5: ZZP
      Compare job details: 5: ZZP
      Research companies : 4: ZZP
    section Bulk Actions
      Select multiple jobs: 5: ZZP
      Favorite promising : 4: ZZP
      Apply to multiple  : 5: ZZP
```

**Desktop Advantages:**
